		<p>Lawrence Wharf is a modern development of 159 units - mainly apartments immediately alongside the River Thames, with a row of houses and further apartments on the Rotherhithe Street side of the development - all built around quiet private communal gardens and a tennis court, adjacent to the Hilton Riverside Docklands Hotel.</p>
		<p>The development clearly shows its Scandinavian design origins, and boasts a large tree and shrub-filled courtyard garden and residents’ tennis court, with extensive secure underground parking. The development is 20+ years old, but is contemporary in appearance and in facilities, tended by an on-site manager.</p>
		<p>Though only 2 minutes from Canary Wharf, on the Hilton’s regular ferryboat service, and 15 minutes from the City on a high-speed Thames Clipper boat, Lawrence Wharf is a peaceful – even tranquil – home for a wide variety of city commuters, artists, young professionals and those wishing to enjoy the fruits of their labours in a pleasant atmosphere, where most residents also delight in spectacular river views.</p>
